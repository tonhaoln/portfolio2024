**Live:** [podcombined.com](https://www.podcombined.com)

**Timeline:** 3 weeks concept → live deployment

**Result:** 105 users in first 2 months, with sellers using it daily for margin calculations.

**What was delivered:** Working product designed and built end-to-end—from identifying the problem to deploying live with real users.

## The Problem

### 15 Minutes to 30 Seconds

Print on Demand sellers manually compare profit margins across providers using spreadsheets. Each calculation takes 15-20 minutes and becomes outdated as pricing shifts.

PODCombined delivers real profit margins across 100+ provider-product-region combinations in under 30 seconds.

## How It Was Built

### Design → Development → Deployment in 3 Weeks

**Design**

- User interface and comparison tool layouts
- Input flows and result visualisation
- Responsive design across devices

**Development**

- Frontend (React, Next.js)
- Data scraping and JSON processing
- Multi-currency support and conversion
- Deployment to production

**Approach:** AI-accelerated development with design foundations first. Component architecture and UX patterns created stable constraints before implementation. Technical decisions favoured simplicity: CSV files over databases, USD-only storage with display conversion, proven stack over experimental tools.

## What This Proves

**End-to-end product capability:**
- Identified real user problem through observation
- Designed clean interface with established UX patterns
- Built functional product with complex data handling
- Deployed to production and acquired real users
- Iterated based on actual usage

**Speed:** 3 weeks from concept to live product with users.

**Learning:** Shipping fast meant learning fast. The product improved because real people used it, revealing friction points that planning never would have anticipated. Early release beats perfect planning.
