## The Brief

### Communicating Impact Through Interactive Storytelling

OzHarvest needed their 2023 impact report to do more than list statistics. They wanted an engaging digital experience that would bring their achievements to life for stakeholders, partners, and donors—showing the human impact behind the numbers across their four pillars: Feed, Educate, Advocate, and Innovate.

The challenge: balance substantial content delivery with an experience that keeps users engaged and makes complex data accessible.
