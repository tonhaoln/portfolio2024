## The Brief

### Digital Presence for Social Impact

HomeGround Real Estate Sydney addresses the housing crisis by providing rental homes for essential workers, families under housing stress, and the "hidden homeless." They needed a website that clearly communicated their mission while guiding different audiences—property owners, tenants, and developers—toward relevant actions.

The challenge: create an engaging, visually dynamic site that balances social impact messaging with practical user journeys.

## What I Delivered

### Clear Journeys with Dynamic Visual Elements

I led the UX/UI design and frontend development, creating a site that uses visual storytelling to communicate HomeGround's mission while keeping navigation intuitive.

**Design**

- Large image tiles clearly defining customer journeys for tenants, landlords, and developers
- Strategic calls to action encouraging engagement
- Custom graphics including wallpaper inspired by the logo's house graphic
- Cohesive branding unifying all sections

**Development**

- Custom frontend build (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Dynamic text and image elements with entry animations (left/right margins meeting centre)
- Responsive design across all devices
- Performance optimisation
