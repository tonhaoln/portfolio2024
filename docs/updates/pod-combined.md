## Problem & Solution

### 15 Minutes to 30 Seconds

Print on Demand sellers manually compare profit margins across providers using spreadsheets. Each calculation takes 15-20 minutes and becomes outdated as pricing shifts.

PODCombined delivers real profit margins across 100+ provider-product-region combinations in under 30 seconds.

## Design & Development

### Foundation-First Development with AI Acceleration

**Design**

- User interface and comparison tool layouts
- Input flows and result visualisation
- Responsive design across devices

**Development**

- Frontend (React, Next.js)
- Data scraping and JSON processing
- Multi-currency support and conversion
- Deployment to production

Built in 3 weeks using AI as development accelerator. Design foundations and component architecture came first, creating stable constraints for implementation. Technical decisions favoured simplicity: CSV files over databases, USD-only storage with display conversion, proven stack over experimental tools.
