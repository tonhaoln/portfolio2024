## The Brief

### Digital Home for a World-Class Academy

The Academy Byron Bay is a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu facility led by world champion black belt Thalison Soares (200k+ followers). They needed a website that reflected their world-class coaching while making it easy for new students to explore classes, book trials, and understand what makes the academy different.

The challenge: create a clean, professional presence that matches the academy's elite reputation while keeping the site easy for the team to update.
