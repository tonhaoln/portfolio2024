## The Brief

### Three Distinct Audiences, One Website

Australian Youth Orchestra needed a website redesign serving three user groups: prospective participants and families researching programs, concert-goers booking tickets, and donors seeking impact transparency. Each audience had different goals and required clear pathways without competing for attention.

The challenge: balance immediate clarity for each audience while maintaining a unified brand experience that reflects the orchestra's national prestige and artistic excellence.
