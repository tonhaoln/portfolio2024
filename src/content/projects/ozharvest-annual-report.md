## Context

OzHarvest is Australia's leading food rescue organisation. Every year they need their impact report to do more than list numbers. An engaging digital experience for stakeholders, partners, and donors.

I've designed and built this for three consecutive years (2023, 2024, 2025). Each year the client brings new references and feedback from the previous version. Same content, same branding, but a different experience every time.

## Design Decisions

The layout changed every year. The underlying principle didn't: users scan, not read.

Progressive disclosure became the constant — collapsible sections, clear typography, well-defined navigation. That held across all three designs. Everything else moved around it.

> Redesigning, not iterating, worked because the principle was stable.

Each year was a different take on the same problem: how do you make data-heavy content feel light? The constraint was always the same, lots of content, limited attention, but the approach kept evolving based on what the previous year's feedback told us and what the client was asking for when they shared new references.

CMS for client independence so they can manage updates themselves without needing me for every text change.

## Outcome

Three years running. Each year started from scratch with new references and last year's feedback.

> The relationship compounds — understanding the client's content, their audience, and how they communicate gets sharper every year.

That's what makes redesigning viable instead of just starting over.
