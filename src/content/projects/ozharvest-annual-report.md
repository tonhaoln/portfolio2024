## Context

OzHarvest is Australia's leading food rescue organisation. Every year they need their impact report to do more than list numbers, an engaging digital experience for stakeholders, partners, and donors.

## Design Decisions

I've designed and built this for three consecutive years (2023, 2024, 2025). The scope stays consistent, but so does the challenge: lots of content, limited attention.

That shaped the core principle: users scan, not read. Once we aligned on that, we could prioritise experience over completeness.

- **Progressive disclosure:** collapsible sections, clear typography, well-defined navigation.
- **Three visual strategies:** redesigned each year, not reskinned. Each year tested a different approach to data-heavy content.
- **CMS for client independence:** they can manage updates themselves without needing me for every text change.

## Outcome

Three years running. This project isn't about innovation, it's about craft and trust.
