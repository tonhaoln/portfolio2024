## Context

WORK180 helps women find workplaces that actually support them. Over 100 endorsed employers, including Microsoft, BHP, and Atlassian, needed a better way to communicate workplace policies to job seekers. The existing template was burying the information that mattered most.

## Research

I led UX at WORK180 for close to two years, working alongside a Head of Product, Head of Engineering, two PMs, a Data Analyst, and four Engineers. I ran internal and external surveys and usability testing on wireframe prototypes with real users. Those findings shaped everything that followed.

> The data showed two things clearly: Flexible Working and Shared Caring Responsibility were what users cared about most.

So instead of giving every policy equal weight, I designed the template to lead with what mattered, making the most sought-after information the easiest to find.

## The Build

The centrepiece was the Equity Board — spreadsheet data turned into a consumer-facing experience with a mobile-first focus, evolved from early wireframes through team feedback. I built a component system that kept every profile cohesive regardless of how much content an employer had to share.

## Outcome

After launch, employer profiles saw a 275% increase in organic traffic.

> The redesigned template was adopted across all endorsed employers.
