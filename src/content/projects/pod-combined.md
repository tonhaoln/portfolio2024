## The Product

Print-on-demand sellers manually compare profit margins across providers using spreadsheets. No side-by-side comparison tool existed. POD Combined delivers real profit margins across 100+ provider-product-region combinations in under 30 seconds.

CSV over database, USD-only storage — prove the calculation engine first, invest in complexity later.

## The Process

The product story isn't the interesting part. The process story is.

This was my first attempt building end-to-end with AI as co-pilot. I rebuilt it three times before finding the right approach.

- **Build 1 failed:** prompting reactively, fixing problems as they appeared. AI over-engineered and missed edge cases.
- **Build 2 improved:** realised better prompting wasn't enough. Created a structured Knowledge Base for context and constraints.
- **Build 3 worked:** invested entirely in the Knowledge Base before writing code: project overview, product laws, tech stack, development phases. The AI stayed on track because the constraints were clear.

> That Knowledge Base approach became my foundation for everything I built after.

AI handled backend logic and deployments, but the UI needed to feel human. That's where I stay hands-on.

## Outcome

305 users in the first 2 months, with sellers using it daily for margin calculations. A clean, live product that works.

> Distribution is the next challenge.
