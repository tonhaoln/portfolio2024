    <h2 slot="body">Making Employer Commitments Easy to Find</h2>

    <p slot="body">WORK180's Endorsed Employers—including Microsoft, BHP, and Atlassian—needed a better way to communicate their workplace policies to women job seekers. The existing profile template made it difficult for users to discover and assess what actually mattered: Flexible Working Arrangements, Shared Caring Responsibility, and other key commitments.</p>

    <p slot="body">The challenge: redesign the template so women could effortlessly explore, assess, and validate employer offerings in one place.</p>
