    <p slot="section">Overview</p>

    <h2 slot="body">From Problem to Deployed Product</h2>

    <p slot="body">Print on Demand sellers manually compare profit margins across providers using spreadsheets. Each calculation takes 15-20 minutes and becomes outdated as pricing shifts.</p>

    <p slot="body">PODCombined.com delivers real profit margins across 100+ provider-product-region combinations in under 30 seconds.</p>

    <p slot="body">This project demonstrates end-to-end product capability. Problem framing, interface design, technical implementation, and deployment with AI as a development accelerator.</p>

    <p slot="section">Takeaway</p>

    <h2 slot="body">Clear Problem Framing</h2>

    <p slot="body">Sellers don't need another dashboard. They need faster margin comparison. This framing created clear constraints: solve one problem well and reduce 15-20 minute calculations to under 30 seconds.</p>

    <h2 slot="body">Foundation-First Development</h2>

    <p slot="body">Design foundations came before features. Component library, design tokens, and interaction patterns created stable constraints for AI implementation. Technical decisions favored simplicity: CSV files instead of databases, USD-only storage with display conversion, proven stack, and phased development with working functionality at each stage.</p>

    <h2 slot="body">Real Usage Drives Iteration</h2>

    <p slot="body">Early release revealed friction points that planning missed. Users struggled with price input formatting and needed currency flexibility. Email-gated exports built the first newsletter list. Real behavior drove iteration, not assumptions.</p>

    <h2 slot="body">Building with AI</h2>

    <p slot="body">
        This project demonstrates the full product development cycle with AI as an implementation accelerator. Focus areas included product direction, problem framing, architecture, and design foundations. AI handled component implementation, validation logic, and data transformation. The result is a working product serving real sellers at <a href="https://podcombined.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">podcombined.com</a>.
