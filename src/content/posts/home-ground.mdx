    <p slot="body">HomeGround Real Estate Sydney tackles the housing crisis by providing rental homes for those in need, including essential workers, families under housing stress, and the “hidden homeless.”</p>
    
    <p slot="body">Led by Antonio, the project centred on UX/UI and front-end development to create a visually engaging, user-friendly website aligned with HomeGround's mission.

    <p slot="section">Takeaway</p>

    <h2 slot="body">Clear User Journeys and Calls to Action</h2>
    
    <p slot="body">The website's design features large image tiles that clearly define customer journeys for tenants, landlords, and developers, with strategically placed calls to action that encourage user engagement.</p>
    
    <h2 slot="body">Engaging Visual and Text Elements</h2>
    
    <p slot="body">The design incorporates dynamic text and image elements that enter from left and right margins to meet in the centre, creating an engaging and interactive visual experience that captures the user's attention.</p>
    
    <h2 slot="body">Custom Graphics and Branding</h2>
    
    <p slot="body">To unify the site's aesthetic, custom graphics, including a wallpaper inspired by the logo's house graphic, were developed. These elements visually link sections and reinforce the brand's identity.</p>
